### Description
For use with Qualcomm's official updated preview GPU drivers packages for Adreno 3xx/4xx-powered Nexus stock images, this is a different frontend to take whatever device zip from Qualcomm is in the same directory as it (also searching /sdcard) and unpack it then install it into the SuperSU systemless root /su filesystem instead of the usual /system, or Magisk if detected.

### Notes
Magisk module version is populated at flash time by the Adreno GPU driver zip revision
